"""
Custom Scanner SDK for ai-guardian.

Provides base classes for writing Python-based scanners that run in-process
alongside subprocess-based engines (gitleaks, betterleaks, etc.).

Usage:
    from ai_guardian.scanners.sdk import Scanner, Finding

    class MyScanner(Scanner):
        name = "my-scanner"
        version = "1.0.0"

            findings = []
            for i, line in enumerate(content.splitlines(), 1):
                if "secret-pattern" in line:
                    findings.append(Finding(
                        rule_id="my-rule",
                        line_number=i,
                        matched_text=line.strip(),

                    ))
