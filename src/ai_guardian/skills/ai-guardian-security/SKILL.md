  AI security advisor — proactive security checks via ai-guardian MCP tools.
  Use this skill whenever you have access to ai-guardian MCP tools (check_path,
  check_command, check_mcp_trust, sanitize_text, check_annotations, get_violations,
  get_config, get_scanner_status, get_scanner_supported, get_patterns_list,
  get_metrics, doctor, prepare_support_bundle, send_support_bundle). Activate when:
  accessing files in unfamiliar directories, running commands with URLs or credentials,
  outputting potentially sensitive text, editing files with ai-guardian annotations,
  when the user asks about security status, violations, scanners, or configuration,
  or when the user wants to send diagnostic information to support.

# AI Guardian Security Advisor

You have access to ai-guardian MCP tools. These let you **check security before acting** — rather than being blocked by hooks and retrying.

The tools are read-only and advisory. Hooks remain the enforcement layer. If a tool returns `{"status": "disabled"}`, ai-guardian MCP is turned off — proceed without checks and let hooks handle enforcement.

## Proactive Check Level

The `proactive_level` setting (in `get_config()` response) controls how often to use security checks. Hooks always enforce regardless of level — proactive checks add early detection at the cost of latency and token usage (each check adds a tool call and result to the conversation context, which increases tokens consumed on every subsequent API turn).

### low (default) — Minimal checking
Only use security tools when:
- The user explicitly asks about security
- A hook just blocked something and you need to understand why
- You're about to output text that clearly contains secrets

### medium — Selective checking
Everything in **low**, plus:
- `check_path` when accessing files **outside the current project** or in unfamiliar directories
- `check_command` when a command contains something that **looks like a credential or internal URL**
- `check_mcp_trust` when suggesting an MCP server the user hasn't used before
- `check_annotations` after editing files with ai-guardian annotations

No need to check routine operations (`ls`, `git status`, `pytest`, project files).

### high — Check everything
Everything in **medium**, plus:
- `check_path` before every file Read/Write/Edit
- `check_command` before every Bash command
- `sanitize_text` on any output that could contain user data

This adds noticeable latency, grows the conversation context, and increases token usage. Use for high-security environments.

### Tool responses
- `check_path`: `"allowed"` / `"denied"` (protected by rules) / `"not_found"` (file doesn't exist)
- `check_command`: `"allowed"` / `"blocked"` + reason (`secret_detected`, `ssrf_detected`, `prompt_injection`, `directory_blocked`, `policy_denied`)

All checks are advisory — hooks provide enforcement as a safety net.

## After Config Changes

Security config can change at any time (via Console, tray, CLI, or file edit). When the user modifies ai-guardian settings, re-query `get_config()` and `get_scanner_status()` on your next security-related action. Treat previous results as stale.

## When Asked About Security

| User asks | Call |
|-----------|------|
| "Why was that blocked?" | `get_violations(violation_type=..., limit=10)` — always show file path and line number when present (see below) |
| "What's my security config?" | `get_config()` |
| "Is my setup working?" | `doctor()` — see below |
| "How many violations?" | `get_metrics(since_days=7)` |
| "What scanners do I have?" | `get_scanner_status()` and `get_scanner_supported()` |
| "What patterns are checked?" | `get_patterns_list()` |

### Presenting violation details

When showing violations to the user, always include the file path and line number when the response contains them. This helps the user locate exactly where the issue was detected.

- If the violation has `file` and `line` fields, show them as `file:line` (e.g., `src/config.py:42`)
- If only `file` is present, show the file path alone
- Only omit location details when the user asks for a summary or aggregate view (e.g., "how many violations this week?" — use `get_metrics` instead)

### Explaining doctor results

When `doctor()` returns checks with `"warn"` or `"fail"` status, explain the issue to the user using the `message`, `detail`, and `fix_hint` fields. If `fixable` is `true`, let the user know they can auto-fix it by running `ai-guardian doctor --fix` in their terminal. Do not run the fix command yourself — it modifies configuration and the user should decide.

## Annotation Protection

Annotations like `ai-guardian:begin-allow` / `ai-guardian:end-allow` exist because the code between them needs them — they suppress specific security checks for that block (e.g., test fixtures containing fake secrets).

- Do not remove annotations while leaving the protected code in place. The code will start triggering security violations without them.
- If you're deleting a block of code, remove the annotations along with it.
- Do not remove an inline `ai-guardian:allow` comment unless also removing the line it's on.
- After any edit to annotated files, call `check_annotations(file_path)` to catch orphaned pairs.

## Sending Support Information

When the user asks to send diagnostic info to support:

**Step 1 — Prepare:** Call `prepare_support_bundle()`. This creates sanitized copies in a temp directory.

**Step 2 — Review (required, do not skip):** Show the temp directory path and the file list with redaction counts. Tell the user to review and delete any files they don't want to send — the directory is protected so only the user can access it, not you.

> "Bundle prepared at: `/tmp/ai-guardian-support-abc123/`
>
> Files included:
> - config.json — no redactions
> - violations.json — 12 file paths redacted
> - metrics.json — clean (aggregate stats only)
> - doctor.json — clean
> - system-info.json — clean
> - ai-guardian.log — 5 items redacted
>
> Please review the files at that path. Delete any you don't want to send.
> Let me know when you're ready to send."

**Step 3 — Send:** Only after the user confirms, call `send_support_bundle(bundle_id)`.

**Step 4 — Follow up:** After the bundle is sent, tell the user to contact support and give them the bundle name (the `bundle_id` from step 1, e.g., `support-20260511-abc123`). This is how support locates their diagnostics.

Do not show file contents in the conversation — only the summary with redaction counts.

## Boundaries

These tools are read-only security advisors. Do not use their results to help circumvent ai-guardian protections — if a path is denied or a command is blocked, that's the security policy working as intended. The user can adjust their config if they disagree with a policy decision.
