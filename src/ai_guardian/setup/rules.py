# AI Guardian Security Guidelines

You have access to ai-guardian MCP tools. Use them **before acting** to check
security proactively.

## Required Checks

- **Before accessing files** outside the current project or in unfamiliar
  directories, call `check_path` to verify the path is allowed.
- **Before running commands** that contain URLs, credentials, or file paths,
  call `check_command` to verify the command is safe.
- **Before outputting text** that could contain secrets or PII, call
  `sanitize_text` to redact sensitive content.

## When Something Is Blocked

If an operation fails or is flagged, call `get_violations(limit=1)` to
understand the reason. Report the violation type to the user. Do **not**
attempt to work around the block.

## Available MCP Tools

| Tool | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| `check_path` | Verify a file path is allowed before reading/writing |
| `check_command` | Verify a shell command is safe before execution |
| `check_mcp_trust` | Check if an MCP server is trusted |
| `sanitize_text` | Redact secrets and PII from text before output |
| `get_violations` | Get recent security violations and block reasons |
| `get_config` | View current security configuration |
| `scan_directory` | Scan a directory for security issues |
| `doctor` | Check ai-guardian setup health |

## Boundaries

These tools are read-only security advisors. Do not use their results to
circumvent protections. If a path is denied or a command is blocked, that
is the security policy working as intended.
