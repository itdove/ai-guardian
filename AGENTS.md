# Agent Instructions for AI Guardian

## General Instructions

**IMPORTANT**: The following general instructions apply to the AI Guardian project and MUST be followed when contributing to this codebase.

---

### Git Workflow

**IMPORTANT**: Never commit directly to the `main` branch. Always create a feature branch before making any commits.

#### Creating Branches and Pull Requests

1. **Check if a branch already exists** for this work. If the current branch matches the issue (e.g., the branch name contains the issue number), use it directly — do **not** create a new branch.

2. **If no branch exists**, update main and create one:
   ```bash
   git checkout main
   git pull origin main
   git checkout -b <issue-key>-<short-description>
   ```
   **IMPORTANT**: Always ensure your main branch is up-to-date before creating a new feature branch.

   Example: `git checkout -b feature-add-secret-scanning`

3. **Make your changes** and commit them to the branch

4. **Push the branch** to remote:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin <branch-name>
   ```

5. **Create a PR** using the GitHub CLI (`gh`) or web interface

#### Creating Pull Requests

```bash
# Install gh CLI if needed
brew install gh  # macOS
# For other platforms: https://cli.github.com/

# Authenticate
gh auth login

# Create a pull request
gh pr create --title "Your PR Title" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'

### Testing

**CRITICAL**: All code changes MUST include appropriate tests.

#### Running Tests

**Note**: Tests are only required when making code changes. Documentation-only changes do not require running tests.

**Run only tests related to your changes** — GitHub Actions runs the full suite on every PR across Python 3.9-3.14 and Windows.

#### Which Tests to Run

1. **Changed method → run its test file directly**
   ```bash
   uv run --extra dev python -m pytest tests/test_<module>.py -v
   ```

2. **Callers of changed method → run tests that reference it**
   ```bash
   grep -rl '<method_name>' tests/ | xargs uv run --extra dev python -m pytest -v
   ```

3. **Full suite → only before PR submission or when touching shared modules** (`constants.py`, `config/loaders.py`, `__init__.py`)
   ```bash
   uv run --extra dev python -m pytest
   ```

Using [uv](https://docs.astral.sh/uv/) (recommended):

```bash
# Run tests related to your changes
uv run --extra dev python -m pytest tests/test_<related>.py -v

# Run tests matching a keyword
uv run --extra dev python -m pytest -k "test_something" -v

# Run full suite only if needed (CI does this automatically)
uv run --extra dev python -m pytest
```

Or using pip:

```bash
pip install ai-guardian[dev]
pytest tests/test_<related>.py -v
pytest -k "test_something" -v
```

#### Test Structure

- Place all tests in the `tests/` directory
- Test files should be named `test_*.py`
- Test functions should be named `test_*`
- Use pytest fixtures for common setup

#### Test Coverage

- **Target**: Maintain >70% code coverage
- Run coverage reports before submitting PRs
- Add tests for new features and bug fixes

#### NiceGUI / Web Console Tests (Python 3.9 Incompatibility)

**NiceGUI requires Python >= 3.10.** Tests that import anything from `src/ai_guardian/web/` will fail on Python 3.9 because `from nicegui import ui` fails at module import time.

**Required pattern** — always guard web component imports with `pytest.importorskip`:

```python
# At module level, before any web imports:
nicegui = pytest.importorskip("nicegui", reason="NiceGUI requires Python >= 3.10")

# Or per-class with a mark:
import pytest
pytestmark = pytest.mark.skipif(
    not __import__("importlib").util.find_spec("nicegui"),
    reason="NiceGUI requires Python >= 3.10",
)
```

This ensures the test is **skipped** on Python 3.9 rather than **erroring**, which is the correct behavior — the web console is not supported on 3.9, and tests that exercise it should skip cleanly.

### User Experience Contract Tests

**IMPORTANT**: When adding or modifying security features that affect what users see in Claude Code, create UX contract tests in `tests/ux/`.

**When to create UX contract tests:**

1. **New security protections** - Any feature that blocks/allows operations based on threats
2. **Modified blocking behavior** - Changes to how/when operations are denied
3. **New user-facing messages** - Error messages, warnings, or permission prompts
4. **Hook behavior changes** - Modifications to PreToolUse/PostToolUse responses

**What UX contract tests should document:**

- ✅ **Expected user experience** - What users SHOULD see in the IDE
- ✅ **Security behavior** - When operations are blocked vs allowed
- ✅ **Error messages** - Exact messages users see for different threats
- ✅ **Permission flow** - Whether prompts are shown or bypassed
- ✅ **Manual verification** - Step-by-step guide for testing in actual Claude Code

**Examples:**

- `tests/ux/test_user_experience_contract.py` - PreToolUse hook behavior (issue #224)
- `tests/ux/test_user_experience_contract_mcp.py` - MCP security features (issue #226)

**Test isolation requirements:**

- ⚠️ **CRITICAL**: UX tests MUST NOT use the user's `~/.config/ai-guardian/ai-guardian.json`
- ✅ Mock all `_load_*_config()` functions using `@patch` decorators
- ✅ Use explicit configuration dicts in tests (e.g., `ToolPolicyChecker(config={...})`)
- ✅ Ensure tests pass in CI/CD without any system configuration

**Template for UX contract tests:**

```python
@patch('ai_guardian._load_secret_scanning_config')
@patch('ai_guardian._load_pattern_server_config')
def test_user_experience_feature_name(self, mock_pattern_config, mock_scan_config):
    """
    USER EXPERIENCE: [Brief description] → [Expected outcome]

    Scenario:
    1. User asks Claude: "[Example user request]"
    2. Claude tries to [action]
    3. ai-guardian [hook] runs
    4. [Threat/condition detected]

    Expected User Experience:
    ❌/✅ [What happens]
    🛡️ User sees: "[Exact message]"
    ⚠️ [Additional context]
    """
    # Configure mocks (avoid loading user's config)
    mock_pattern_config.return_value = None
    mock_scan_config.return_value = ({"enabled": True}, None)
    
    # Test implementation...
```

**Benefits of UX contract tests:**

- 📖 Living documentation of expected behavior
- 🧪 Verification that protections work as designed
- 👥 Manual testing guide for QA
- 🔒 Ensures security messages are clear and actionable

### Hook Regression Testing (dummy-agent)

Before submitting PRs that touch hook processing (`hook_processing.py`), scanner logic, or the dummy-agent, run the bundled hook scenarios against the test container image.

**When to run:**

- Changes to `src/ai_guardian/hook_processing.py`
- Changes to any scanner (`secret_scanning`, `ssrf_protector`, `tool_policy`, etc.)
- Changes to `src/ai_guardian/dummy_agent.py` or any hook adapter

**How to run:**

```bash
# Build the base image
podman build -t ai-guardian container/

# Build the test image on top
podman build -f container/Dockerfile.test -t ai-guardian-test container/

# Run all bundled scenarios (CI mode — exits non-zero on any failure)
podman run --rm ai-guardian-test /sandbox/run-scenarios.sh

# Run a specific scenario
podman run --rm ai-guardian-test \
  ai-guardian dummy-agent --script /sandbox/scenarios/basic-secret.yaml

# Interactive REPL for manual exploration
podman run -it ai-guardian-test ai-guardian dummy-agent
```

**Bundled scenarios:**

| Scenario | What it tests |
|---|---|
| `basic-secret.yaml` | AWS key detection → block |
| `pii-detection.yaml` | Credit card, passport detection |
| `ask-dialog.yaml` | Ask dialog forwarding to tray |
| `tool-policy.yaml` | Directory rules, tool blocking |

See `container/README.md` for full build and run options.

## Common Issues

### AI Guardian Blocking File Reads

If ai-guardian hooks prevent you from reading project files (e.g., `Hook PreToolUse:Read denied this tool`), ask the user to pause ai-guardian temporarily.
The user can run: `ai-guardian pause 5` (pauses for 5 minutes).
DO NOT run this command yourself — ai-guardian will block it.

The user can resume protection at any time with `ai-guardian resume`.

### GitHub Push Protection Blocking Test Secrets

When writing tests that include fake/test secrets (API keys, tokens, etc.), GitHub's secret scanning push protection may block your push even though the secrets are intentionally fake. This is especially common when testing secret detection or redaction features.

**Problem**: GitHub's secret scanner is very sensitive and detects patterns that match real secret formats, even with obviously fake values.

**Solutions**:

1. **Use public/less sensitive patterns** (Recommended):
   - Instead of `sk_test_...` (Stripe secret key), use `pk_test_...` (public key)
   - Instead of `ghp_...` (GitHub personal token), use fake patterns that don't match real formats
   - Example: Change `sk_test_{24+ chars}` to `pk_test_{24+ chars}` (public key pattern)

2. **Use patterns that match your regex but not GitHub's**:
   - Test with minimum-length or all-X patterns
   - Use obviously fake prefixes where possible
   - Example: For testing general patterns, use `FAKE_sk_test_...` instead of `sk_test_...`

3. **If GitHub still blocks**:
   - GitHub provides a URL in the error message to allow the specific secret
   - Click the URL and choose "It's used in tests" → "Allow secret"
   - This requires repository admin access

**Real Example from Phase 4**:
When implementing secret redaction tests, GitHub blocked:
- Stripe test secret key format → Detected as "Stripe Test API Secret Key"
- Slack token format with obvious fake values → Detected as "Slack API Token"

Solution: Changed to use public key patterns (e.g., `pk_test_` prefix) which GitHub allows, since they're less sensitive than secret keys.

**Best Practice**: When testing secret detection, prefer using public key patterns or less sensitive token types that still validate your regex patterns without triggering GitHub's scanner.

---

## Security: AI Guardian Self-Protection

AI Guardian MUST NEVER provide information on how to bypass its own protections
to the AI agent. This applies to:

- MCP server tool responses
- Skill instructions
- Error messages returned via hooks
- Console output (Console must not run inside an AI session)

**Safe**: tell the user WHAT was blocked and WHY.

**Unsafe**: tell the agent HOW to suppress, disable, or work around the block.

Specifically, MCP tool responses and error messages must never include:

- Allowlist instructions or annotation syntax
- Configuration keys or values that disable protections
- The `!` prefix bypass for running commands
- `.ai-read-deny` file removal instructions
- Pattern regex or detection rule details

---

## Release Management

### Overview

AI Guardian follows a structured release management process to ensure stable releases while enabling continuous development. The project uses semantic versioning and git flow branching strategy.

### Version Numbering

We follow [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/):
- **MAJOR.MINOR.PATCH** (e.g., 1.0.0, 1.1.0, 1.1.1)
- **Development**: X.Y.Z-dev (on main branch)

Examples:
- `1.0.0` - First stable release
- `1.1.0` - Added new features
- `1.1.1` - Bug fixes only
- `1.2.0-dev` - Development version on main

### Branch Strategy

- **main**: Active development (version X.Y.0-dev)
- **release-X.Y**: Stable release branches (e.g., release-1.0, release-1.1)
- **hotfix-X.Y.Z**: Critical fixes for released versions
- **Tags**: vX.Y.Z for each release

### Quick Reference

**Automated Release Workflow (Recommended):**

```bash
# Using the /release skill in Claude Code (automated)
/release minor              # Create minor version release (1.1.0 -> 1.2.0)
/release patch              # Create patch version release (1.1.0 -> 1.1.1)
/release major              # Create major version release (1.0.0 -> 2.0.0)
/release hotfix v1.1.0      # Create hotfix from v1.1.0 tag
/release test               # Create TestPyPI test release
```

The `/release` skill automates:
- Version updates in both `pyproject.toml` and `src/ai_guardian/__init__.py`
- CHANGELOG.md updates with proper formatting
- Git branch creation and commit messages
- Safety checks and validation
- Cursor hook compatibility verification (semi-automated gate)
- Post-release guidance

**Manual Release Workflow (Alternative):**

```bash
# Check version
python -c "import tomllib; print(tomllib.load(open('pyproject.toml', 'rb'))['project']['version'])"

# Release workflow (see RELEASING.md for details)
git checkout -b release-1.0 main    # Create release branch
# Update version in pyproject.toml, CHANGELOG.md, run tests
git tag -a v1.0.0 -m "Release 1.0.0"
git push origin v1.0.0  # Triggers GitHub Actions to publish to PyPI

# Hotfix workflow (see RELEASING.md for details)
git checkout -b hotfix-1.0.1 v1.0.0
# Fix bug, update version, update CHANGELOG.md
git tag -a v1.0.1 -m "Hotfix 1.0.1"
git push origin v1.0.1  # Triggers GitHub Actions
```

### Automated Publishing

AI Guardian uses GitHub Actions for automated publishing:

1. **Push a version tag** (e.g., `v1.0.0`)
2. **GitHub Actions automatically**:
   - Builds distribution packages
   - Publishes to PyPI
   - Creates GitHub Release with changelog notes

**No manual PyPI publishing needed** - just push the tag!

### Documentation

- **RELEASING.md**: Complete step-by-step release and hotfix procedures
- **CHANGELOG.md**: All notable changes, following [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/) format
- **Version storage**: `pyproject.toml` (line 7) and `src/ai_guardian/__init__.py` (line 13)
- **Release skill**: `/release` command for automated releases (see skill documentation)

See [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) for detailed instructions, or use the `/release` skill for automated workflow.

## REST API & Version Compatibility

### Backward Compatibility Contract

The system tray is the controlling component and connects to daemons across local, container, and Kubernetes runtimes. The tray version MUST always be >= every connected daemon's version. The tray detects version mismatches and warns the user to upgrade outdated daemons.

**Rules for contributors:**

1. **Tray must tolerate missing fields.** Use defensive `.get(key, default)` when reading daemon API responses — older daemons may not return newer fields (e.g., `stats.get("mcp_installed", False)`).

2. **Never remove or rename existing API fields.** Adding new fields is safe; removing or renaming breaks older trays connecting to newer daemons.

3. **Never change field semantics.** A field's type and meaning must remain stable across versions.

4. **New endpoints are safe.** Older trays will never call endpoints they don't know about.

5. **Test with older daemon versions.** When adding new tray features that depend on new API fields, verify the tray still works when the field is absent.

### REST API Endpoints

| Endpoint | Method | Key Response Fields |
|----------|--------|---------------------|
| `/api/health` | GET | `status` |
| `/api/status` | GET | `running`, `paused`, `uptime_seconds`, `version`, `name`, `mcp_installed`, `menu_tags` |
| `/api/stats` | GET | All fields from `DaemonState.get_stats()` + `name`, `menu_tags` |
| `/api/config` | GET | `features` (feature enabled/disabled flags) |
| `/api/violations` | GET | `violations`, `count` (query: `?type=...&limit=...`) |
| `/api/metrics` | GET | `total_violations`, `by_type`, `by_severity`, `resolved`, `unresolved` (query: `?since_days=...`) |
| `/api/pause` | POST | `status`, `minutes` (requires auth token) |
| `/api/resume` | POST | `status` (requires auth token) |
| `/api/reload` | POST | `status` (requires auth token) |
| `/api/tray-plugins` | GET | `plugins` array |

## Code Quality

### Log Level Guidelines

Use `logging.getLogger(__name__)` in all modules. Choose levels as follows:

- **CRITICAL**: Security audit gaps — a violation was detected and blocked but the violation record failed to persist (e.g., secret detection log failure). Operators must be alerted immediately.
- **ERROR**: Operation failures needing investigation — violation logging failures (non-secret), daemon startup failures, config load errors that fall back to defaults.
- **WARNING**: Degraded protection — a security scanner check raised an exception and was skipped for one file, URL parse failure in SSRF protector, config value parse failure using default instead.
- **INFO**: Normal operational events — daemon started/stopped, config reloaded, scanner installed/updated.
- **DEBUG**: Expected operational conditions — daemon not running when client checks, optional module not available, network timeouts during discovery.

**Silent `except...pass`** is acceptable ONLY for:
- Import availability checks (`except ImportError: HAS_X = False`)
- Cleanup/teardown (socket close, file close, process kill)
- TUI widget queries during Textual mount/dismount lifecycle
- Must include `# intentionally silent — <reason>` comment

**Never silently swallow**:
- Security-relevant exceptions (violation detection or logging paths)
- Config file read/parse errors (log at WARNING minimum)
- Bare `except:` — always use specific exception types

### Linting

The project uses multiple linters enforced by CI. **Run these after finishing all implementations:**

```bash
# 1. Auto-fix formatting with black
black src/ai_guardian/ tests/

# 2. Auto-fix safe lint issues with ruff
ruff check src/ai_guardian/ tests/ --fix

# 3. Re-run black (ruff fixes may need reformatting)
black src/ai_guardian/ tests/

# 4. Verify all checks pass
ruff check src/ai_guardian/ tests/
black --check src/ai_guardian/ tests/
pylint src/ai_guardian/ --disable=all --enable=E \
  --disable=E1101,E0611,E2515,E2502,E0602,E0601,E1123,E1120,E0213,E0102,E0203,E1129,E0401 \
  --output-format=text
```

Ruff configuration is in `pyproject.toml` under `[tool.ruff]`. Pylint only checks for E-level (error) violations — conventions and warnings are excluded.

### Pre-commit Checks

Before submitting a PR:

**For code changes:**
1. Run all tests: `pytest`
2. Check test coverage: `pytest --cov=ai_guardian`
3. Run linters: `black`, `ruff check`, `pylint` (required — CI will block if they fail)
4. Update CHANGELOG.md if making notable changes

**For documentation-only changes:**
1. Update CHANGELOG.md if making notable changes
2. Tests are not required for markdown/comment-only changes

## Continuous Integration

### GitHub Actions Workflows

1. **Tests** (`.github/workflows/test.yml`)
   - Runs on: push to main, pull requests
   - Tests: Python 3.9, 3.10, 3.11, 3.12, 3.13, 3.14
   - Coverage: Uploaded to Codecov

2. **Lint** (`.github/workflows/lint.yml`)
   - Runs on: pull requests
   - Checks: pylint, black, ruff

3. **Publish** (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`)
   - Runs on: version tags (v*)
   - Actions: Build, publish to PyPI, create GitHub Release

4. **Release Readiness** (`.github/workflows/release-readiness.yml`)
   - Runs on: workflow_dispatch, push to release-* branches
   - Jobs:
     - **fresh-install**: Clean install across Python 3.9–3.14 (version, doctor, config profiles, patterns, show-config)
     - **upgrade-from-previous**: Upgrade from previous stable release, permissions migration
     - **multi-agent-setup**: All IDE adapters (claude, cursor, copilot, gemini, codex, windsurf, cline, augment, kiro)
     - **daemon-lifecycle**: Start/status/reload/REST API (health, status, pause, resume)/stop
     - **smoke-tests**: Calls `.github/workflows/smoke-tests.yml` (detection scan, hook pipeline, false positives)
     - **config-validation**: Doctor, permissions migration, profiles, config merge (project + user level)
     - **mcp-server**: JSON-RPC initialize and tool call response
   - **⚠️ IMPORTANT**: When adding new CLI commands, config options, IDE adapters, detection patterns, or daemon endpoints, update this workflow to test them. The `/release` skill runs this workflow as a gate before releasing.

5. **Smoke Tests** (`.github/workflows/smoke-tests.yml`)
   - Runs on: pull_request to main, workflow_call, workflow_dispatch
   - Jobs:
     - **detection-scan**: All violation types via `ai-guardian scan` (secrets, PII Phase 1+2, prompt injection, jailbreak, SSRF, config exfil, context poisoning)
     - **hook-pipeline**: Hook event processing via `process_hook_data()` (PreToolUse secret deny, PreToolUse directory block, PostToolUse redaction, UserPromptSubmit injection)
     - **false-positives**: Clean code, env vars, pytest tracebacks produce no findings
   - Called by release-readiness.yml via `workflow_call`

6. **Integration Tests** (`.github/workflows/integration-tests.yml`)
   - Runs on: schedule (daily 2 AM UTC), workflow_dispatch, pull requests
   - Jobs:
     - **version-check**: Verifies scanner versions exist (runs on all triggers)
     - **version-health-check**: Checks for version updates (schedule/manual only)
       - Monitors scanner versions for updates
       - Checks LeakTK pattern server for new pattern versions
       - Creates/updates GitHub issues when versions outdated
       - Duplicate prevention and daily status updates
     - **integration-tests**: Runs MCP integration tests
     - **test-isolation**: Verifies no state leakage between test runs
     - **performance-check**: Ensures tests complete within time limits

### Scanner Version Health Monitoring

The daily integration test workflow includes automated dependency health monitoring:

**What is checked:**
- Scanner versions (gitleaks, betterleaks, leaktk) from `pyproject.toml`
- LeakTK pattern server version from `ai-guardian-example.json`
- Age of pinned versions (warns if >30 days old)
- Availability of newer versions

**When issues are created:**
- Scanner version is >30 days old
- Newer scanner version is available
- LeakTK pattern server has newer patterns available

**Issue management:**
- Label: `scanner-version-update`
- Smart duplicate prevention
- Daily updates via comments
- Auto-closes when versions updated

**Manual checks:**
```bash
# Check if versions exist (original behavior)
python scripts/check_scanner_versions.py

# Check for updates and age
python scripts/check_scanner_versions.py --check-updates --output versions.json
cat versions.json | jq
```

### Dependabot Dependency Updates

Dependabot automatically monitors and creates pull requests for dependency updates.

**What Dependabot monitors:**

1. **GitHub Actions** (`.github/dependabot.yml`)
   - Monthly checks for action version updates
   - Covers: actions/checkout, actions/setup-python, codecov/codecov-action, etc.
   - Labels: `ci-cd`, `dependabot`
   - Commit prefix: `ci:`
   - PR limit: 5 concurrent PRs
   - **Grouping**: All updates (minor, patch, and major) are grouped into single PRs to reduce noise

2. **Python Packages** (from `pyproject.toml`)
   - Monthly checks for package updates
   - Covers: textual, jsonschema, requests, pyyaml, tomli, pytest, etc.
   - Labels: `enhancement`, `dependabot`
   - Commit prefix: `deps:`
   - PR limit: 10 concurrent PRs
   - **Grouping**: All updates (minor, patch, and major) are grouped into single PRs to reduce noise

**Dependabot vs Scanner Version Checking:**

| Feature | Dependabot | Scanner Checking (#291) |
|---------|-----------|------------------------|
| GitHub Actions | ✅ Automated PRs | ❌ Not applicable |
| Python packages | ✅ Automated PRs | ❌ Not applicable |
| Scanner versions | ❌ Not standard packages | ✅ Custom checking |
| Security alerts | ✅ Built-in CVE database | ⚠️ Manual review needed |
| Update frequency | Monthly | Daily |
| Delivery | Pull requests | GitHub issues |

**Handling Dependabot PRs:**

1. **Review the PR**: Check changelog and breaking changes
2. **Verify CI passes**: All tests must pass
3. **Merge**: Use "Squash and merge" for clean history
4. **Security PRs**: Prioritize and merge quickly

**Configuration file**: `.github/dependabot.yml`

---

## Dependency Management

### Overview

AI Guardian uses a multi-layered approach to dependency management:

1. **Dependabot** - GitHub Actions and Python packages (monthly)
2. **Scanner Version Checking** - Custom scanners (daily)
3. **Manual Updates** - For major version changes requiring testing

This approach ensures dependencies stay current while maintaining stability through testing.

### License Compliance

**CRITICAL**: Always check the license of any library or tool before importing or adding it as a dependency.

**Why License Compliance Matters:**
- AI Guardian is licensed under Apache-2.0 (permissive license)
- Some licenses (e.g., GPL, AGPL) have copyleft requirements that may conflict
- License violations can create legal liability for users
- External tools used via subprocess have different requirements than embedded libraries

**License Checking Workflow:**

1. **Before adding any dependency** (Python package, scanner, tool, or library):
   ```bash
   # For Python packages
   pip show <package-name> | grep License
   
   # For GitHub projects
   # Check the LICENSE file in the repository
   # Look for license badge in README.md
   
   # For scanners/tools
   # Check the project's GitHub repository for LICENSE file
   ```

2. **Evaluate license compatibility**:
   
   **✅ Compatible Licenses** (safe to use):
   - Apache-2.0 (same as AI Guardian)
   - MIT (permissive)
   - BSD (2-clause, 3-clause)
   - ISC (permissive)
   
   **⚠️ Requires Review** (use with caution):
   - LGPL (can be used if dynamically linked)
   - MPL-2.0 (file-level copyleft, generally OK)
   
   **⚠️ External Tool Exception** (OK via subprocess):
   - GPL-3.0 (when used as external tool via subprocess)
   - AGPL-3.0 (when used as external tool via subprocess)
   - **Important**: Document in MULTI_ENGINE_SUPPORT.md or similar
   - **Important**: Add interactive license notice during installation
   - **Example**: TruffleHog (AGPL-3.0) is OK because it's invoked via subprocess
   
   **❌ Incompatible** (do NOT use as embedded library):
   - GPL-3.0 (strong copyleft when embedded)
   - AGPL-3.0 (network copyleft when embedded)
   - Proprietary/closed-source licenses
   - "No license" or missing license information

3. **Document license decisions**:
   
   **For standard Python packages** (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD):
   - Add to `pyproject.toml` dependencies
   - No additional documentation needed
   
   **For tools with GPL/AGPL** (used via subprocess):
   - Document in appropriate docs (e.g., `MULTI_ENGINE_SUPPORT.md`)
   - Add interactive license notice in installer
   - Explain subprocess vs embedded library distinction
   - Provide alternative scanners for organizations with license concerns
   
   **Example documentation** (from TruffleHog implementation):
   ```markdown
   ### License Considerations
   
   - TruffleHog uses AGPL-3.0 license (copyleft)
   - AI Guardian uses TruffleHog as external tool via subprocess
   - No derivative work created, no AGPL obligations for AI Guardian
   - Interactive license notice shown during installation
   - Alternative scanners available (gitleaks, betterleaks, detect-secrets)
   ```

4. **Add to CHANGELOG.md**:
   ```markdown
   ### Added
   - **New Dependency**: package-name (v1.0.0)
     - License: MIT
     - Purpose: [brief description]
   ```

**Common Scenarios:**

- **Adding Python package**: Check with `pip show`, verify license is compatible
- **Adding scanner tool**: Check LICENSE file in GitHub repo, document if GPL/AGPL
- **Importing JavaScript library**: Check package.json or npm page for license
- **Using external API/service**: Check terms of service and license

**Red Flags:**
- No LICENSE file in repository
- "All rights reserved" or similar proprietary language
- Unclear or custom licenses without OSI approval
- Dual licensing where free tier has restrictive terms

**When in Doubt:**
- Prefer well-known permissive licenses (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD)
- For GPL/AGPL tools: Only use via subprocess, not as embedded library
- Consult license compatibility matrix: https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/License_compatibility
- Ask in PR review before merging

### Automated Dependency Monitoring

#### Dependabot (GitHub Actions & Python Packages)

**Configuration**: `.github/dependabot.yml`  
**Frequency**: Monthly (1st of month)  
**Delivery**: Pull requests

**What it monitors**:
- GitHub Actions (actions/checkout, actions/setup-python, codecov/codecov-action, etc.)
- Python packages (textual, jsonschema, requests, pyyaml, tomli, pytest, etc.)

**Workflow**:
1. Dependabot scans dependencies monthly
2. Creates PRs for available updates (grouped to reduce noise)
3. CI tests run automatically on PRs
4. Review and merge PRs

**Handling Dependabot PRs**:
```bash
# View Dependabot PRs
gh pr list --label dependabot

# Review specific PR
gh pr view <PR-NUMBER>

# Minor/patch updates - quick review and merge
gh pr merge <PR-NUMBER> --squash

# Major updates - test locally first
gh pr checkout <PR-NUMBER>
pytest
gh pr merge <PR-NUMBER> --squash
```

**Labels and organization**:
- GitHub Actions updates: `ci-cd`, `dependabot` labels, `ci:` commit prefix
- Python package updates: `enhancement`, `dependabot` labels, `deps:` commit prefix

#### Scanner Version Checking (Gitleaks, BetterLeaks, LeakTK)

**Workflow**: `.github/workflows/integration-tests.yml`  
**Frequency**: Daily (2 AM UTC)  
**Delivery**: GitHub issues with label `scanner-version-update`

**What it monitors**:
- gitleaks pinned version vs latest release
- betterleaks pinned version vs latest release
- leaktk pinned version vs latest release
- LeakTK pattern server version
- Version existence (prevents broken downloads)
- Version age (alerts if >30 days old)

**Workflow**:
1. Daily check compares pinned vs latest versions
2. Creates GitHub issue if version is outdated (>30 days old)
3. Updates existing issue daily with current status
4. Auto-closes when versions are updated in `pyproject.toml`
5. Verifies pinned versions still exist on GitHub

**Responding to version update issues**:

1. **Review the issue**:
   - Check which scanners need updating
   - Review changelog for breaking changes at scanner's GitHub release page
   - Note security fixes (prioritize these)

2. **Test locally**:
   ```bash
   # Install new version
   ai-guardian scanner install gitleaks --version <NEW_VERSION>
   
   # Run tests
   pytest tests/
   pytest tests/integration/
   
   # Verify scanner works
   gitleaks version
   ```

3. **Update pinned version** (`pyproject.toml`):
   ```toml
   [tool.ai-guardian.scanners]
   gitleaks = "<NEW_VERSION>"
   betterleaks = "<NEW_VERSION>"
   leaktk = "<NEW_VERSION>"
   ```

4. **Update CHANGELOG.md**:
   ```markdown
   ### Changed
   - Updated scanner versions:
     - gitleaks: 8.30.1 → 8.31.0
     - betterleaks: 1.1.2 → 1.2.0
   ```

5. **Commit and push**:
   ```bash
   git add pyproject.toml CHANGELOG.md
   git commit -m "deps: update scanner versions
   
   - gitleaks: 8.30.1 → 8.31.0
   - betterleaks: 1.1.2 → 1.2.0
   
   Resolves #<ISSUE_NUMBER>"
   git push
   ```

6. **Issue auto-closes** when commit is merged to main

**Comparison: Dependabot vs Scanner Version Checking**

| Feature | Dependabot | Scanner Checking (#291) |
|---------|-----------|------------------------|
| GitHub Actions | ✅ Automated PRs | ❌ Not applicable |
| Python packages | ✅ Automated PRs | ❌ Not applicable |
| Scanner versions | ❌ Not standard packages | ✅ Custom checking |
| Security alerts | ✅ Built-in CVE database | ⚠️ Manual review needed |
| Update frequency | Monthly | Daily |
| Delivery | Pull requests | GitHub issues |

### Manual Dependency Updates

For dependencies not covered by automation or when you need to update immediately:

**Check current versions**:
```bash
# Python package versions
pip list | grep -E "textual|jsonschema|requests"

# Scanner versions
ai-guardian scanner list

# GitHub Actions versions
grep "uses:" .github/workflows/*.yml
```

**Update Python packages**:
```bash
# Test with new version
pip install <package>==<NEW_VERSION>
pytest

# If tests pass, update pyproject.toml
# Then update CHANGELOG.md and commit
```

**Update GitHub Actions**:
```bash
# Find current usage
grep "actions/checkout@" .github/workflows/*.yml

# Update manually in workflow files
# Test via workflow_dispatch
gh workflow run <workflow-name>
```

**Manual scanner version check**:
```bash
# Check if versions exist (quick check)
python scripts/check_scanner_versions.py

# Check for updates and age (detailed analysis)
python scripts/check_scanner_versions.py --check-updates --output versions.json
cat versions.json | jq
```

### Best Practices

**Scanner Version Updates**:
- ✅ Test new versions locally before updating `pyproject.toml`
- ✅ Run full test suite (`pytest` + `pytest tests/integration/`)
- ✅ Update CHANGELOG.md with version changes
- ✅ Prioritize security fixes (update ASAP)
- ✅ Review scanner changelog for breaking changes
- ⚠️ Never update scanners without testing

**Dependabot PRs**:
- ✅ Minor/patch updates: Quick review, merge if CI passes
- ✅ Major updates: Test locally, review changelog carefully
- ✅ Security updates: Merge ASAP after quick validation
- ✅ Check for grouped updates (multiple packages in one PR)
- ⚠️ Don't ignore Dependabot PRs - they accumulate

**Version Pinning Strategy**:
- **Scanner versions**: Exact pinning (gitleaks = "8.30.1")
  - Ensures reproducible builds
  - Updated monthly or when security issues found
  - Always tested before updating
  
- **Python packages**: Minimum versions (textual>=0.47.0)
  - Allows automatic patch/minor updates
  - Tested via CI on every commit
  - Major versions require manual update and testing

### Troubleshooting

**Issue: Dependabot PR fails CI**
```bash
# Checkout PR locally
gh pr checkout <PR-NUMBER>

# Run tests to see failure
pytest -v

# Fix if needed, or close PR and create issue
# If breaking change, may need code updates
```

**Issue: Scanner version doesn't exist**
```bash
# Check if version exists on GitHub
curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/gitleaks/gitleaks/releases/tags/v8.30.1

# If 404, update to latest available version
# Follow manual update workflow above
```

**Issue: Version checking workflow failed**
```bash
# Check workflow logs
gh run view <RUN_ID>

# Common causes:
# - GitHub API rate limit (wait 1 hour)
# - Network timeout (rerun workflow)
# - Invalid pyproject.toml format (fix syntax)
```

**Issue: Grouped Dependabot PR too large**
```bash
# Dependabot groups all updates into fewer PRs
# If grouped PR has issues:
# 1. Close the grouped PR
# 2. Disable grouping temporarily in .github/dependabot.yml
# 3. Let Dependabot create individual PRs
# 4. Merge individually after testing
# 5. Re-enable grouping
```

### Monitoring

**Check for pending updates**:
```bash
# Dependabot PRs
gh pr list --label dependabot

# Scanner version issues
gh issue list --label scanner-version-update

# Recent dependency changes
git log --grep="deps:" --oneline
```

**Audit dependency health**:
```bash
# Check scanner versions locally
python scripts/check_scanner_versions.py --check-updates

# Check Python package vulnerabilities (optional)
pip install safety
safety check
```

**View automated check results**:
```bash
# View latest integration test run
gh run list --workflow=integration-tests.yml --limit 1

# View specific run details
gh run view <RUN_ID>
```

### Version Update Frequency

| Dependency Type | Check Frequency | Update Trigger | Delivery Method |
|----------------|-----------------|----------------|-----------------|
| Scanner versions | Daily (2 AM UTC) | >30 days old OR new version available | GitHub issue |
| Python packages | Monthly (1st of month) | New version available | Dependabot PR |
| GitHub Actions | Monthly (1st of month) | New version available | Dependabot PR |
| Security fixes | Immediate | CVE/advisory published | Dependabot PR (security label) |

**Related workflows**: See "Continuous Integration" section above for details on GitHub Actions workflows that support dependency management.

## Configuration Schema Changes

**CRITICAL**: When adding new configuration options to the JSON schema, you MUST update multiple files to ensure consistency across the codebase.

### Files to Update

When modifying the configuration schema:

1. **JSON Schema** (`src/ai_guardian/schemas/ai-guardian-config.schema.json`)
   - Add new properties with descriptions
   - Define types, defaults, and validation rules
   - Update documentation strings

2. **Setup Config** (`src/ai_guardian/setup/config.py`)
   - Update the `_get_default_config_template()` function
   - Add new configuration options with appropriate defaults
   - Include comment fields (`_comment_*`) for documentation
   - **CRITICAL**: This ensures `ai-guardian setup --create-config` includes new options
   - Note: `setup/__init__.py` is a thin orchestrator; the real config template is in `setup/config.py`

3. **Example Config** (`ai-guardian-example.json`)
   - Add the new configuration option with example values
   - Include detailed comments explaining usage
   - Provide security warnings and use cases where appropriate
   - **CRITICAL**: This file serves as the primary reference for users

4. **Console** (if applicable)
   - Check if the Console auto-generates from schema or needs manual updates
   - Most Console components auto-generate from schema, but verify
   - Update Console tests if configuration affects UI

5. **Code Implementation**
   - Update the relevant detector/module to read new config options
   - Add tests for new configuration options
   - Ensure backward compatibility (provide sensible defaults)

6. **Documentation**
   - Update README.md with configuration examples
   - Update CHANGELOG.md under `[Unreleased]` section
   - Update relevant docs/* files with detailed explanations
   - Add examples and security warnings

**Checklist for Schema Changes:**
- [ ] Update JSON schema with new property
- [ ] Update setup/config.py default config (`_get_default_config_template()`)
- [ ] Update ai-guardian-example.json with examples
- [ ] Verify Console compatibility (usually auto-generates)
- [ ] Implement code to read new config
- [ ] Add comprehensive tests
- [ ] Update documentation (README, CHANGELOG, docs/*)
- [ ] Test `ai-guardian setup --create-config` output
- [ ] If adding a new pattern category: update `ai-guardian patterns list` command (Issue #337)

### Example: Adding Unicode Detection

When Unicode detection was added (Issue #195):

1. ✅ **Schema** - Added `unicode_detection` section under `prompt_injection`
2. ✅ **Setup.py** - Added `unicode_detection` dict to `prompt_injection` config
3. ✅ **Implementation** - `UnicodeAttackDetector` class reads config
4. ✅ **Documentation** - README.md and CHANGELOG.md updated

**Why This Matters:**
- Users running `ai-guardian setup --create-config` get complete configuration files
- New features are discoverable in the generated config
- Consistency between schema, setup, and implementation
- Prevents missing configuration options in fresh installations

---

## Documentation Guidelines

### README Size Limit

**CRITICAL**: The README.md must be kept to **~300 lines maximum**. It serves as a concise landing page, not a comprehensive reference.

**Rules:**
- Every feature gets **one line** in the README + a link to its docs/ page
- No code examples longer than **5 lines** in README
- Detailed configuration, examples, and edge cases go in `docs/`
- Keep Quick Start as simple as possible (3 commands)

### Documentation Structure

All detailed documentation lives in the `docs/` folder:
- `docs/README.md` — Index of all documentation files
- `docs/CONFIGURATION.md` — Full configuration reference
- `docs/security/` — Security feature documentation
- `docs/CONSOLE.md` — Interactive console guide
- `docs/TOOL_POLICY.md` — Permission system details
- `docs/SECURITY_DESIGN.md` — Architecture and self-protection

**When adding a new feature:**
1. Add a one-line entry to the README Features table with a link
2. Create or update the appropriate `docs/` file with full details
3. Update `docs/README.md` index if creating a new file
4. Update CHANGELOG.md

**When modifying existing features:**
- Update the relevant `docs/` file, not the README
- Only update README if the feature name or one-line description changes

---

## New Feature Checklist

When adding any new feature, check:

- [ ] **MCP tool** — Is it read-only/query? Would AI benefit from calling it? → Add MCP tool in `mcp_server.py` + update skill
- [ ] **Tray menu** — Does it produce a quick status or count? → Add to tray in `daemon/tray.py`
- [ ] **Console panel** — Does it have configurable settings? → Add Console UI in `tui/` and `web/pages/`
- [ ] **CLI command** — Does it need a standalone command? → Add to CLI in `__init__.py`
- [ ] **Multi-agent compatibility** — Does it affect hook responses? → Test with all supported IDEs. Verify adapter's `format_response()` returns correct format. See [docs/AGENT_SUPPORT.md](docs/AGENT_SUPPORT.md) for the full agent capability matrix and adapter architecture.
- [ ] **Agent documentation** — Adding a new IDE/agent? → Update ALL tables in `docs/AGENT_SUPPORT.md`: Supported Agents, Hook Capability Matrix, Violation Type Coverage Matrix, Agent Confidence Levels, Hook Event Name Mapping, Response Format Differences, Config File Locations.
- [ ] **Violation type documentation** — Adding a new violation type? → Add a row to the Violation Type Coverage Matrix in `docs/AGENT_SUPPORT.md` and document any agent-specific limitations.
- [ ] **`.aiguardignore.toml` scanner type** — Adding a new violation/scanner type that scans file content (not URL-based or tool-based)? → Add it to `SCANNER_TYPES` in `src/ai_guardian/aiguardignore.py` so `.aiguardignore.toml` can filter it.

### Adding a New Security Scanner

A scanner is a new detection engine that integrates into the hook pipeline and `ai-guardian scan`. Use `supply_chain` (Issue #1055) and `code_scanning` (Issue #828) as reference implementations. Every item below is required — missing any one causes a broken or incomplete feature.

#### 1. Dependency
- [ ] `pyproject.toml` — add fixed or optional dependency

#### 2. Scanner module
- [ ] `src/ai_guardian/<scanner>.py` — scanner class with `scan(content, file_path)` → returns findings

#### 3. Violation type
- [ ] `src/ai_guardian/constants.py` — add `ViolationType.<SCANNER> = "<scanner>"` to enum
- [ ] `src/ai_guardian/hook_processing.py` — add entry to `_ASK_VIOLATION_LABELS`

#### 4. Config loading
- [ ] `src/ai_guardian/config_loaders.py` — add `_<SCANNER>_DEFAULTS` dict + `_load_<scanner>_config()` function

#### 5. Hook integration
- [ ] `src/ai_guardian/hook_processing.py`:
  - Import `_load_<scanner>_config` at top of file
  - Add `_log_<scanner>_violation()` (follow `_log_supply_chain_violation` pattern)
  - Add `run_<scanner>_scan()` returning `ScanResult` with `result.extra["action"]` set
  - Wire into the correct hook path (PreToolUse Write/Edit, PostToolUse Bash, UserPromptSubmit, etc.)
  - Use `_handle_ask_mode_auto()` → `_log_ask_decision()` for ask-mode dispatch

#### 6. Batch scan (`ai-guardian scan`)
- [ ] `src/ai_guardian/scanner.py` — add import, `_check_<scanner>()` method, call it in `_scan_file()` (and `_scan_image_file()` if applicable)
- [ ] `src/ai_guardian/sarif_formatter.py` — add `create_<scanner>_finding()` factory; import it in `scanner.py` inside the `HAS_SARIF` try block

#### 7. MCP server
- [ ] `src/ai_guardian/mcp_server.py` — add suggestion string to `_SAFE_SUGGESTIONS` dict; `scan_directory` picks up new findings automatically via `FileScanner`

#### 8. Config defaults & schema
- [ ] `src/ai_guardian/setup/config.py` — add `"_comment_<scanner>"` (top-level) **and** `"_comment_action"`, `"_comment_enabled"` etc. (nested inside the scanner dict) to `_get_default_config_template()`. These are auto-extracted into `CONFIG_FIELD_HELP` by `_build_field_help()` — every `_comment_*` key you add here becomes a tooltip automatically.
- [ ] `src/ai_guardian/help_content.py` — for any field not covered by a `_comment_*` key in `setup/config.py`, add a manual entry to `_FIELD_HELP_SUPPLEMENT` following the `"<scanner>.<field>"` key convention.
- [ ] `src/ai_guardian/schemas/ai-guardian-config.schema.json`:
  - Add `"<scanner>"` object with full property definitions
  - Add `"<scanner>"` to the `violation_type` enum array (two places: `enum` + `default`)
- [ ] `ai-guardian-example.json` — add fully-commented example block for the new section
- [ ] All four profile templates: `src/ai_guardian/templates/profiles/{minimal,standard,strict,moderator}.json`

#### 9. TUI console
- [ ] `src/ai_guardian/tui/<scanner>.py` — new `*Content(Container)` panel (config status, violations, inline help). Add `_apply_tooltips()` method that calls `CONFIG_FIELD_HELP.get("<scanner>.<field>")` and sets `.tooltip` on key widgets (enable toggle, action select, etc.). Call `_apply_tooltips()` from `on_mount()` after `load_config()`.
- [ ] `src/ai_guardian/tui/app.py`:
  - Add `("Label", "panel-<scanner>")` to the relevant `NAV_GROUPS` section
  - Add `with Container(id="panel-<scanner>"): yield <Scanner>Content()` in the compose tree
  - Add `"panel-<scanner>": ("...")` entry to `PANEL_DESCRIPTIONS`
- [ ] `src/ai_guardian/tui/global_settings.py`:
  - Add `("<scanner>", "gs_<scanner>", "emoji Label")` to `FEATURE_TOGGLES`
  - Add `"<scanner>": {"schema_path": ..., "options": [...], "default": ...}` to `FEATURE_ACTIONS`
- [ ] `src/ai_guardian/tui/violations.py`:
  - Add `"<scanner>"` to `KNOWN_VIOLATION_TYPES`
  - Handle `vtype == "<scanner>"` in `_extract_matched_from_violation()`
  - Add `TabPane("Label", id="filter-<scanner>")` + `VerticalScroll(id="violations-list-<scanner>")` in compose
  - Add load call in `load_all_filters()`
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_tui.py` — update nav leaf count assertion

#### 10. Web console
- [ ] `src/ai_guardian/web/pages/<scanner>.py` — new `create_<scanner>_page(service, daemon_name)` with enable toggle, action selector, config options. Import `field_help_icon` from `ai_guardian.web.components.help_panel` and add `field_help_icon("<scanner>")` next to section headers and `field_help_icon("<scanner>.<field>")` next to individual field labels (action, ignore_files, ignore_tools, etc.).
- [ ] `src/ai_guardian/web/app.py` — add `@ui.page("/{daemon_name}/<slug>")` route
- [ ] `src/ai_guardian/web/components/header.py` — add `("Label", "/<slug>")` to the relevant nav group
- [ ] `src/ai_guardian/web/pages/global_settings.py`:
  - Add `("<scanner>", "Label", "description")` to the relevant `DASHBOARD_SECTIONS` group
  - Add `"<scanner>": {...}` to `ACTION_MODES`
  - Add `"<scanner>": "<default>"` to `ACTION_DEFAULTS`
- [ ] `src/ai_guardian/web/pages/dashboard.py`:
  - Add `("<scanner>", "Label", "description")` to `DASHBOARD_SECTIONS`
  - Add `"<scanner>": "<slug>"` to `FEATURE_PAGE_SLUGS`
  - Add `"<scanner>": "<default_action>"` to `_DEFAULT_ACTIONS`
  - Handle the scanner in `_get_scanner_label()` if it produces violations
- [ ] `src/ai_guardian/web/pages/violations.py`:
  - Add `"<scanner>"` to `KNOWN_VIOLATION_TYPES`
  - Add `("Label", "<scanner>", "description")` to `FILTER_TABS`
  - Add `"<scanner>": [("Field", "key"), ...]` to `DETAIL_FIELDS`
  - Handle `vtype == "<scanner>"` in `_extract_matched_from_violation()`

#### 11. Tests
- [ ] `tests/unit/test_<scanner>.py` — unit tests: clean input, known-bad input, config options (threshold, allowlist), suppression annotations, robustness (empty input, parse errors)

#### 12. Help tooltips
- [ ] `src/ai_guardian/setup/config.py` — add `_comment_*` keys inside the scanner dict in `_get_default_config_template()` for each configurable field so they surface automatically as tooltips in both consoles
- [ ] `src/ai_guardian/help_content.py` → `_FIELD_HELP_SUPPLEMENT` — add any field that `setup/config.py` doesn't cover with a `_comment_*` key (use `"<scanner>.<field>"` keys)
- [ ] `src/ai_guardian/tui/<scanner>.py` — `_apply_tooltips()` sets `.tooltip` on key widgets from `CONFIG_FIELD_HELP`
- [ ] `src/ai_guardian/web/pages/<scanner>.py` — `field_help_icon("<scanner>.<field>")` called next to every section and field label
- [ ] `src/ai_guardian/web/pages/global_settings.py` — existing loop calls `field_help_icon(section)` and `field_help_icon(f"{section}.action")` automatically for any new scanner added to `FEATURE_GROUPS`
- [ ] `src/ai_guardian/tui/global_settings.py` — existing `_apply_tooltips()` loop covers any new scanner added to `FEATURES`

#### 13. Don't forget
- [ ] `.aiguardignore.toml` scanner type — add to `SCANNER_TYPES` in `aiguardignore.py` if file-content based
- [ ] `docs/AGENT_SUPPORT.md` — add row to Violation Type Coverage Matrix
- [ ] `CHANGELOG.md` — add entry under `[Unreleased]`
- [ ] `src/ai_guardian/doctor.py` — add `check_<scanner>()` method to verify the scanner's underlying dependency is importable (use `importlib.util.find_spec()`); add it to the `checks` list in `run_all()`; add display name to `_CHECK_DISPLAY_NAMES`; update the check count assertion in `tests/unit/test_doctor.py::TestDoctorRunAll::test_run_all_returns_report`

### TUI and Web Console Coexistence

**IMPORTANT**: The TUI console (`src/ai_guardian/tui/`) MUST NOT be removed while Python 3.9 is still supported. The web console (`src/ai_guardian/web/`) requires NiceGUI, which requires Python >= 3.10. macOS Xcode Command Line Tools bundles Python 3.9.6, so many macOS users will only have 3.9 available. The TUI (Textual) works on all supported Python versions including 3.9.

**Rule**: Both console UIs must be maintained in parallel until Python 3.9 support is dropped. New console panels must be added to both `tui/` and `web/pages/`.

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Feature

1. Create feature branch: `git checkout -b feature-name`
2. Implement feature with tests
3. Update CHANGELOG.md under `[Unreleased]` section
4. Run tests: `pytest`
5. Commit changes
6. Push and create PR

### Fixing a Bug

1. Create bugfix branch: `git checkout -b fix-bug-description`
2. Write failing test that reproduces bug
3. Fix the bug
4. Verify test passes
5. Update CHANGELOG.md under `[Unreleased]` section
6. Commit and create PR

### Preparing a Release

**Recommended: Use the `/release` skill (automated)**
```bash
# In Claude Code
/release minor   # or /release patch, /release major
```

The skill automates steps 2-6 below and provides guidance for step 7.

**Manual alternative:**
1. Follow [RELEASING.md](RELEASING.md) step-by-step
2. Create release branch: `git checkout -b release-X.Y`
3. Update version in `pyproject.toml` and `src/ai_guardian/__init__.py`
4. Update `CHANGELOG.md` (move Unreleased to version section)
5. Run full test suite
6. Commit changes
7. Create and push tag: `git tag -a vX.Y.Z -m "Release X.Y.Z"`
8. GitHub Actions handles the rest automatically
9. Generate combined docs for LLM upload (see below)

### Generating Combined Documentation for LLM Upload

Some LLM tools (e.g., NotebookLM) require single-file upload rather than crawling directories. Generate a combined markdown file from all project documentation:

```bash
# From project root — concatenate all docs with section headers
{
  echo "# AI Guardian — Combined Documentation"
  echo ""
  echo "Auto-generated combined export of all project documentation."
  echo ""
  for f in README.md container/README.md $(find docs -name '*.md' -not -name 'notebooklm-export.md' | sort); do
    echo ""
    echo "# === $f ==="
    echo ""
    cat "$f"
  done
  echo ""
  echo "# === ai-guardian-example.json ==="
  echo ""
  echo '```json'
  cat ai-guardian-example.json
  echo '```'
  echo ""
  echo "# === aiguardignore.schema.json ==="
  echo ""
  echo '```json'
  cat src/ai_guardian/schemas/aiguardignore.schema.json
  echo '```'
  echo ""
  echo "# === CHANGELOG.md (recent) ==="
  echo ""
  # Include only the first 2 released versions (plus Unreleased)
  awk '/^## \[[0-9]/{n++} n>2{exit} {print}' CHANGELOG.md
  echo ""
  echo "*(Earlier versions omitted — see CHANGELOG.md for full history)*"
} > docs/notebooklm-export.md
```

**What's included:**
1. `README.md`
2. `container/README.md` (container image docs)
3. All `docs/*.md` and `docs/security/*.md` files (alphabetically)
4. `ai-guardian-example.json` (wrapped in a JSON code block)
5. `aiguardignore.schema.json` (JSON schema for `.aiguardignore.toml`)
6. `CHANGELOG.md` (trimmed to last 2 released versions)

Each file is separated by a `# === filename ===` header. Total output is ~76k words, well under the 500k-word limit of most LLM tools.

## Security Research & Innovation

### Monitoring Security Patterns

**IMPORTANT**: Periodically check external security research for new patterns and techniques to enhance AI Guardian's protection capabilities.

#### Hermes Security Patterns

Check the [Hermes Security Patterns](https://github.com/fullsend-ai/experiments/tree/main/hermes-security-patterns) repository periodically for:

- New attack vectors and detection patterns
- Novel prompt injection techniques
- Secret detection improvements
- SSRF bypass methods
- Unicode attack variations
- Config file exfiltration patterns

**Recommended Frequency**: Twice-monthly review (1st and 15th) or when planning new features

**How to Integrate New Patterns:**

1. **Review** new patterns/research from Hermes experiments
2. **Evaluate** applicability to AI Guardian's security model
3. **Test** patterns against current detection capabilities
4. **Implement** relevant improvements:
   - Update detection regex patterns
   - Add new test cases

- AI security conference proceedings

### Periodic Pattern Maintenance

**Automated Workflow**: AI Guardian uses GitHub Actions to create twice-monthly reminder issues (1st and 15th) for pattern research across all scanners (prompt injection, context poisoning, secrets, SSRF, config exfil). This ensures patterns stay up-to-date with latest security research.

**Last Research Review**: _[Update after each review - see twice-monthly reminder issues]_

#### Twice-monthly Research Process

On the 1st and 15th of each month, a GitHub Actions workflow automatically creates a reminder issue (`.github/workflows/pattern-research-reminder.yml`) with:

- **Duplicate Prevention**: Checks for existing open reminders before creating new ones
- **Research Checklist**: Pre-populated list of security sources to review
- **Evaluation Criteria**: Guidelines for assessing new patterns
- **Next Steps**: Instructions for creating pattern enhancement issues

**Manual Trigger**: You can also trigger the workflow manually via GitHub Actions UI if needed.

#### Evaluation Criteria for New Patterns

For each discovered pattern, evaluate against these criteria:

**1. Applies to AI IDEs**
- ✅ YES: Pattern affects tools like Claude Code, Cursor, GitHub Copilot
- ❌ NO: Pattern only affects chat interfaces or web-based LLMs

**2. Not a Duplicate**
- ✅ YES: Pattern is genuinely new, not covered by existing detectors
- ❌ NO: Already detected by the relevant scanner (check `prompt_injection.py`, `context_poisoning.py`, `secrets.toml`, `ssrf_protector.py`, `config_scanner.py` as applicable)

**3. Low False Positives**
- ✅ YES: Can detect without blocking legitimate code or documentation
- ❌ NO: Detection would trigger on common programming patterns

**4. Reproducible**
- ✅ YES: Can create concrete examples that demonstrate the attack
- ❌ NO: Theoretical attack without practical demonstration

**5. License Compatible**
- ✅ YES: Source uses permissive open source license (MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD, CC0) or academic fair use
- ❌ NO: Source uses copyleft (GPL/AGPL), proprietary license, or unclear licensing
- **Verification**: For GitHub repos, run `curl -s https://api.github.com/repos/OWNER/REPO | jq -r '.license.spdx_id'`
- **Acceptable licenses**: MIT, Apache-2.0, BSD-2-Clause, BSD-3-Clause, CC0-1.0, ISC, Unlicense, Public Domain
- **Unacceptable licenses**: GPL-2.0, GPL-3.0, AGPL-3.0, proprietary, "All Rights Reserved"
- **Academic papers**: Fair use applies (must cite in CHANGELOG.md and code comments)

#### Decision Matrix: Apply vs Reject

| Criteria Met | Decision | Action |
|--------------|----------|--------|
| All 5 (Applies + Not Duplicate + Low FP + Reproducible + Licensed) | **Apply** | Create pattern enhancement issue using template |
| 4/5 (Missing "Low FP") | **Consider with Caution** | Discuss trade-offs, consider opt-in detection |
| 4/5 (Missing "Reproducible") | **Research Further** | Attempt to create proof-of-concept first |
| 4/5 (Missing "Licensed") | **Reject - Legal Risk** | Cannot use without license compatibility |
| 3/5 or fewer | **Reject** | Document decision, revisit if new evidence emerges |

#### Pattern Addition Workflow

When a new pattern passes evaluation:

1. **Create Pattern Enhancement Issue**
   - Use `.github/ISSUE_TEMPLATE/pattern-enhancement.md`
   - Fill in source information, examples, detection logic
   - Link to twice-monthly research reminder issue

2. **Implement Detection**
   - Add pattern to the appropriate scanner file:
     - **PI**: `src/ai_guardian/prompt_injection.py` — choose category: `JAILBREAK_PATTERNS`, `OBFUSCATION_PATTERNS`, `UNICODE_ATTACK_PATTERNS`, or create new category
     - **Context poisoning**: `src/ai_guardian/context_poisoning.py`
     - **Secrets**: `src/ai_guardian/patterns/data/secrets.toml` — add a new `[[rules]]` entry
     - **SSRF**: `src/ai_guardian/ssrf_protector.py` — blocked IP ranges, domains, or redirect paths
     - **Config exfil**: `src/ai_guardian/config_scanner.py` — new config file path/pattern

3. **Add Test Coverage**
   - Create test cases in the relevant test file (`tests/unit/test_prompt_injection.py`, `tests/unit/test_secret_scanning*.py`, `tests/unit/test_ssrf_protection.py`, etc.)
   - Test attack/match scenarios (should detect)
   - Test safe scenarios (should NOT detect)
   - Verify false positive rate (<1% on sample code)

4. **Update Documentation**
   - Add entry to `CHANGELOG.md` under `[Unreleased] > Added`
   - Credit research source in commit message
   - Update this section's "Last Research Review" date

5. **Update Pattern Listing Command** (Issue #337)
   - If a **new pattern category** was created (e.g., `NORMALIZATION_ATTACK_PATTERNS`), update `ai-guardian patterns list` to include it
   - If a **new configurable key** was added to the schema (e.g., `normalization_patterns`), verify it appears in the listing output
   - Run `ai-guardian patterns list` to confirm the new category/patterns are visible

6. **Submit PR**
   - Reference pattern enhancement issue and twice-monthly reminder
   - Include test results and false positive analysis

#### Example: Adding a New Pattern

**Scenario**: Discovered new Unicode normalization attack from research paper

**Step 1: Evaluation**
- ✅ Applies to AI IDEs (affects all LLM interactions)
- ✅ Not duplicate (Unicode patterns exist but not this specific technique)
- ✅ Low false positives (targets specific invisible characters)
- ✅ Reproducible (PoC provided in paper)

**Decision**: Apply ✅

**Step 2: Create Issue**
```bash
# Use GitHub web interface with pattern-enhancement.md template
# Include the scanner in the title: [Pattern][pi], [Pattern][secrets], [Pattern][ssrf], etc.
gh issue create \
  --title "[Pattern][pi] Unicode normalization zero-width attack" \
  --label "security,pattern-enhancement" \
  --body "$(cat pattern-details.md)"
```

**Step 3: Implement**
```python
# In src/ai_guardian/prompt_injection.py

# Add to UNICODE_ATTACK_PATTERNS
r'[​‌‍⁠﻿]{3,}',  # Zero-width character sequences

# Or create new category if needed
NORMALIZATION_ATTACK_PATTERNS = [
    r'[​‌‍⁠﻿]{3,}',  # Zero-width sequences
    # ... more patterns
]
```

**Alternate example — new secret format (TOML rule in `secrets.toml`)**:
```toml
[[rules]]
id = "example-cloud-key"
description = "Example Cloud Service API Key"
regex = '''(?i)\bexcloud_[0-9a-z]{32}\b'''
tags = ["api-key", "example-cloud"]
keywords = ["excloud_"]

[[rules.allowlists]]
description = "Allowlist test/example values"
regexes = ['''excloud_[0]{32}''']
```

**Step 4: Test**
```python
# In tests/test_prompt_injection.py

def test_unicode_normalization_attack():
    """Test detection of zero-width character attacks."""
    malicious = "Ignore previous​‌‍ instructions"
    result = detector.detect(malicious)
    assert result.threat_detected is True
    assert "unicode" in result.threat_type.lower()

def test_legitimate_unicode_not_blocked():
    """Ensure legitimate Unicode doesn't trigger false positives."""
    safe = "日本語のコメント"  # Japanese comment
    result = detector.detect(safe)
    assert result.threat_detected is False
```

**Step 5: Document**
```markdown
# In CHANGELOG.md under [Unreleased] > Added

- **Unicode Normalization Attack Detection** (Issue #XXX)
  - Detect zero-width character sequences used for prompt injection obfuscation
  - Source: "Adversarial Unicode Attacks on LLMs" (Smith et al., 2026)
  - Patterns: Zero-width joiner/non-joiner sequences (3+ consecutive)
  - Test coverage: 5 attack scenarios, 8 safe scenarios
  - False positive rate: 0.2% on sample codebase
```

#### Tracking Last Review

Update this section after each twice-monthly research review:

**Last Research Review**: _2026-07-06_ *(Update this date after completing twice-monthly review)*

**Review Summary** *(Keep last 3 months)*:
- **2026-07-06**: First review covering all scanners (PI, secrets, SSRF, config exfil). **PI/CP**: No new patterns — Hermes repo had structural rename only (0009-), OWASP LLM Top 10 unchanged, arXiv papers (2506.23260, 2601.09625, 2602.22242) and CVEs (Cursor DuneSlide CVE-2026-50548/50549, Semantic Kernel CVE-2026-25592/26030) confirm architectural/framework threat landscape, 4 candidates rejected. **Secrets**: 6 new patterns from Gitleaks (MIT) — HuggingFace x2, GitHub fine-grained PAT, GitHub user token (ghu_), AWS Bedrock long-lived key, Perplexity — created issue #1482. **SSRF**: 2 unblocked cloud metadata endpoints confirmed via IP range check — Alibaba (100.100.100.200) and Oracle (192.0.0.192) — created issue #1483. **Config exfil**: 2 missing AI IDE config file paths — .github/copilot-instructions.md and .kiro/steering/*.md — created issue #1484. See issue #1435.
- **2026-05-01**: No new patterns found. Reviewed Hermes Security Patterns (Apache-2.0, no new commits since April repo move), OWASP LLM Top 10 2025 and new OWASP Top 10 for Agentic Applications 2026 (ASI01-ASI10), arXiv papers (2601.17548, 2603.21642), and "Comment and Control" attack disclosure. Evaluated 6 candidate patterns (MCP tool poisoning, memory poisoning, cross-context injection, process env snooping, rug pulls, agent goal hijacking) - all rejected (architectural/protocol-level attacks not suitable for regex detection, or duplicates of existing patterns). The 2026 threat landscape is shifting toward agentic/protocol attacks addressed by AI Guardian's MCP security features and hooks, not the pattern module. See issue #336.
- **2026-04-29**: No new patterns found. Reviewed Hermes Security Patterns (context injection, HTML obfuscation, base64 encoding) and OWASP LLM Top 10 2025. Evaluated 3 patterns - all rejected (duplicates or high false positives). Current coverage confirmed comprehensive. See issue #299.
