## Hook Ordering Requirements

### Critical: ai-guardian Must Be First Hook (For Log Mode)

**When using multiple hooks in Claude Code with log mode (`action: "log"`), ai-guardian MUST be the first hook in each hook type's array.**

#### Why This Matters

Claude Code's hook system runs hooks sequentially, but only the **first hook's `systemMessage`** is displayed to the user. Each hook type displays different log mode warnings via `systemMessage`:

- **PreToolUse**: Tool permissions, directory rules
- **UserPromptSubmit**: Prompt injection  
- **PostToolUse**: (No log mode warnings - secret scanning always blocks)

If another hook runs before ai-guardian, warnings are silently suppressed.

#### Wrong Configuration - Warnings Suppressed

```json
{
  "PreToolUse": [
    {
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "command": "other-hook",
          "statusMessage": "Running other hook..."
        },
        {
          "command": "ai-guardian",
          "statusMessage": "🛡️ Checking tool permissions..."
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Result:** ai-guardian warnings are silently suppressed. Users won't see policy violations!

#### Correct Configuration - Warnings Visible

```json
{
  "PreToolUse": [
    {
      "matcher": "*",
      "hooks": [
        {
          "command": "ai-guardian",
          "statusMessage": "🛡️ Checking tool permissions..."
        },
        {
          "command": "other-hook",
          "statusMessage": "Running other hook..."
        }
      ]
    }
  ]
}
```

**Result:** ai-guardian warnings display correctly. Other hooks can still run.

## Hook Types and Warnings

### 1. PreToolUse (Required first for log mode)

**Displays:** Tool permissions violations, directory access violations

**Must be first if:** Using `tool_permissions` or `directory_rules` with `action: "log"`

Checks tool permissions and directory rules before tools execute. In log mode, violations are displayed via `systemMessage`:

```json
"PreToolUse": [
  {
    "matcher": "*",
    "hooks": [
      { "command": "ai-guardian", "statusMessage": "🛡️ Checking tool permissions..." },
      { "command": "your-other-hook" }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Example warnings:**
```
PreToolUse:Skill says: ⚠️ Policy violation (log mode): Skill(database-migration) not in allow list - execution allowed

PreToolUse:Read says: ⚠️ Directory access violation (log mode): Directory rules matched '~/.claude/skills/unapproved/file.txt' - access allowed
```

### 2. UserPromptSubmit (Required first for prompt injection log mode)

**Displays:** Prompt injection detection warnings

**Must be first if:** Using `prompt_injection` with `action: "log"`

**Note:** Secret scanning always blocks (`decision: "block"`) and never uses `systemMessage`, so hook ordering doesn't affect secret detection.

```json
"UserPromptSubmit": [
  {
    "hooks": [
      { "command": "ai-guardian", "statusMessage": "🛡️ Scanning prompt..." },
      { "command": "your-other-hook" }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Example warning:**
```
UserPromptSubmit says: ⚠️ Prompt injection detected (log mode): confidence=0.95 - execution allowed
```

### 3. PostToolUse (Order doesn't matter for log mode)

**Displays:** No log mode warnings (secret scanning always blocks)

**Hook ordering doesn't matter** for log mode warnings because PostToolUse only scans tool outputs for secrets, which always blocks execution regardless of order.

```json
"PostToolUse": [
  {
    "matcher": "*",
    "hooks": [
      { "command": "ai-guardian", "statusMessage": "🛡️ Scanning tool output..." },
      { "command": "your-other-hook" }
    ]
  }
]
```

**Note:** Still recommended to keep ai-guardian first for consistency.

## Hook Limitations

### Why Warning Messages Aren't Displayed

**Claude Code hooks don't display non-blocking messages to users.** When a hook exits with code 0 (success), Claude Code discards all stdout and stderr output. This is why ai-guardian uses **"log" mode** instead of "warn" mode - violations are logged for audit but never shown to users during execution.

#### Claude Code Hook Behavior

| Exit Code | stdout/stderr | Behavior |
|-----------|---------------|----------|
| `0` | Any output | **Discarded** - User sees nothing |
| `!= 0` | stderr content | **Displayed** - User sees error message |

**Result:** Non-blocking warnings (exit 0) are invisible to users.

#### Why This Matters

**1. User Experience**
Users never see policy violations in "log mode":
- No visual feedback that a policy was violated
- No notification that activity is being logged
- Silent operation gives false sense that no policy applies

**2. Naming Accuracy**
"Warn mode" implies users are warned, but they aren't:
- ❌ "Warn" suggests user notification
- ✅ "Log" accurately describes behavior (logged but not shown)

**3. Compliance & Audit**
The actual value is in audit logging, not user warnings:
- All violations logged to ViolationLogger
- Visible in TUI (`ai-guardian tui`)
- Logged at WARNING level for audit
- Perfect for compliance tracking

### What "Log Mode" Does

✅ **Logs violation** at WARNING level  
✅ **Records to ViolationLogger** (visible in TUI)  
✅ **Allows execution** (exit 0)  
❌ **Does NOT show message to user** (Claude Code limitation)

### What "Block Mode" Does

✅ **Logs violation** at ERROR level  
✅ **Records to ViolationLogger** (visible in TUI)  
✅ **Shows error message to user** (exit != 0, stderr displayed)  
✅ **Prevents execution**

### Comparison with Other IDEs

| IDE | Block Mode Messages | Log Mode Messages | Notes |
|-----|-------------------|-------------------|-------|
| **Claude Code** | ✅ Displayed (exit != 0) | ❌ Not displayed (exit 0) | Logs only |
| **Cursor** | ✅ Displayed (`continue: false`) | ❌ Not displayed (`continue: true`) | Tested April 2026 |
| **Aider** | ✅ Displayed (exit != 0) | ❌ Not displayed (exit 0) | Same as Claude Code |
| **GitHub Copilot** | ✅ Displayed (deny) | ❌ No log mode support | Binary only |

**Conclusion:** No major IDE currently supports non-blocking warning messages to users. Log mode is for audit logging only.

## Setup and Verification

### Setup Command Behavior

The `ai-guardian setup` command automatically configures ai-guardian as the **only** hook for each hook type. This ensures correct ordering.

**If you manually add additional hooks:**
1. Always add them **after** ai-guardian in the array
2. Never insert hooks before ai-guardian in PreToolUse or UserPromptSubmit
3. Test that warnings still display by triggering a log mode violation

### Verification Steps

To verify your hook ordering is correct:

1. Configure a feature in log mode (e.g., tool not in allowlist, directory with deny rule)
2. Trigger the violation (e.g., use the tool, read the file)
3. Check if you see the warning: `PreToolUse:ToolName says: ⚠️ ...` or `UserPromptSubmit says: ⚠️ ...`

**If you don't see warnings:**
- Check `~/.claude/settings.json` hook ordering
- Ensure ai-guardian is first in PreToolUse and UserPromptSubmit hooks arrays
- Restart Claude Code to reload configuration

### Alternative: Separate Matchers

If you need different hooks for different tools, use separate matchers:

```json
"PreToolUse": [
  {
    "matcher": "*",
    "hooks": [
      { "command": "ai-guardian" }
    ]
  },
  {
    "matcher": "SpecificTool",
    "hooks": [
      { "command": "other-hook" }
    ]
  }
]
```

This way each matcher has only one hook, avoiding conflicts.

## Use Cases for Log Mode

Since users won't see warnings, log mode is best for:

### 1. Gradual Policy Rollout

```json
{
  "permissions": [{
    "matcher": "Skill",
    "mode": "allow",
    "patterns": ["production-approved-*"],
    "action": "log"  // ← Monitor violations before enforcing
  }]
}
```

**Workflow:**
1. Deploy with `action: "log"`
2. Monitor violations in TUI
3. Identify false positives
4. Adjust patterns
5. Switch to `action: "block"`

### 2. Compliance Audit Mode

```json
{
  "secret_scanning": {
    "enabled": true,
    "action": "log"  // ← Track but don't disrupt workflow
  }
}
```

**Use Case:** Security team wants visibility without blocking developers.

### 3. Policy Testing

```json
{
  "prompt_injection": {
    "enabled": true,
    "action": "log"  // ← Test detection accuracy
  }
}
```

**Use Case:** Identify false positives before enforcing.

### Viewing Violations

Since users don't see warnings in Claude Code, use these methods:

#### 1. TUI (Recommended)
```bash
ai-guardian tui
```

Shows all violations with:
- Timestamp
- Violation type
- Details (tool, pattern, file)
- Action taken (blocked/allowed)
- Suggested fixes

#### 2. Log Files
```bash
# Python logging output
tail -f ~/.local/state/ai-guardian/ai-guardian.log

# Look for WARNING level entries
grep "WARNING" ~/.local/state/ai-guardian/ai-guardian.log
```

#### 3. Violation Logger JSON
```bash
# Raw violation records
cat ~/.local/state/ai-guardian/violations.jsonl | jq .
```

## Best Practices

### Critical Requirements (Log Mode Only)
- **PreToolUse**: ai-guardian MUST be first (displays tool permissions & directory rules warnings)
- **UserPromptSubmit**: ai-guardian MUST be first if using prompt injection log mode (secret scanning blocks regardless of order)
- **PostToolUse**: Order doesn't matter for log mode (no warnings displayed, only blocks secrets)

### Do's and Don'ts

✅ **Do:**
- Run `ai-guardian setup` to configure hooks automatically
- Keep ai-guardian first in all hooks arrays for consistency
- Test warning visibility after adding new hooks
- Use separate matchers for different tools if needed
- Use TUI to monitor log mode violations

❌ **Don't:**
- Add other hooks before ai-guardian in PreToolUse or UserPromptSubmit when using log mode
- Assume warnings will display if ordering is wrong
- Skip testing after modifying hook configuration
- Generate warning messages in log mode (wasted effort - they won't be shown)
- Use "warn" terminology (misleading - use "log" instead)
- Expect users to see violations in IDE UI

**Security Impact:** Incorrect hook ordering can suppress log mode warnings, eliminating visibility into policy violations. Always verify warnings display correctly.

## Technical Details

### Hook Response Formats

**PreToolUse response:**
```json
{
  "hookSpecificOutput": {
    "permissionDecision": "allow",
    "hookEventName": "PreToolUse"
  },
  "systemMessage": "⚠️ Policy violation (log mode): ..."
}
```

**UserPromptSubmit response:**
```json
{
  "systemMessage": "⚠️ Prompt injection detected (log mode): ..."
}
```

Claude Code displays the first hook's `systemMessage` to the user, which is why ordering matters.

### Exit Code Behavior

**Success (exit 0):**
```python
# Hook code
print("⚠️ WARNING: Policy violation", file=sys.stderr)
sys.exit(0)  # Allow execution

# Result: Message printed but Claude Code discards it
# User sees: Nothing
```

**Failure (exit != 0):**
```python
# Hook code
print("🚨 BLOCKED BY POLICY: Violation detected", file=sys.stderr)
sys.exit(2)  # Block execution

# Result: Claude Code displays stderr to user
# User sees: Error message with details
```

## Summary

### For Users

✅ **Use log mode for:**
- Gradual policy rollout
- Compliance auditing
- Testing new policies
- Development environments

✅ **Use block mode for:**
- Production enforcement
- Critical security policies
- Zero-trust environments

✅ **Monitor violations via:**
- `ai-guardian tui` (best UX)
- Log files (automation)
- ViolationLogger (programmatic access)

### For Developers

✅ **Do:**
- Use "log" terminology consistently
- Document that violations are logged, not shown
- Direct users to TUI for violation visibility

❌ **Don't:**
- Generate warning messages in log mode (wasted effort)
- Use "warn" terminology (misleading)
- Expect users to see violations in IDE UI
